# auto-circos

_auto-circos_ is a script that allows users to create circos plots for many samples all at once. The script takes in a .txt file that lists all the sample VCF file names seperates by new lines and outputs plots for DEL, INS, DUP, and BND as well as a circos plot for all of them on one plot. Output is a simple one page PDF for each sample.

# Package Requirements

_auto_circos_ requires the [Circlize Package](https://jokergoo.github.io/circlize_book/book/) and the [Structual Variant Annotation Package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/StructuralVariantAnnotation.html). Documentation is linked for both.
